## Finished Projects

### 2023: ML for cloud optical thickness estimation

* Project partners: [Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)](https://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi/who-we-are/who-we-are-1.83748), [AI Sweden](https://www.ai.se/en), [Luleå University of Technology](https://www.ltu.se/?l=en) and the [Swedish Forestry Agency](https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/).
* The work was published in the journal Remote Sensing (2024), got accepted as an oral at the 2nd ML-for-RS Workshop at ICLR 2024, and was presented as a poster at EUMETSAT 2023. Funded by Vinnova. One of the project deliverables was a developer event (Hackathon) for university students.
