title: Dense Stream Flow Forecasting
enddate: 2022-12-31
description: "In this work we propose a machine learning-based approach for predicting water flow intensities in inland watercourses based on the physical characteristics of the catchment areas, obtained from geospatial data in addition to temporal information about past rainfall quantities and temperature variations. We are the first to tackle the task of dense water flow intensity prediction; earlier works have considered predicting flow intensities at a sparse set of locations at a time."
